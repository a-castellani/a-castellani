ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I embarked on a coding adventure at Le Wagon boot camp on July 2023, where I gained hands-on experience with a comprehensive tech stack, including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES6, SQL, Git, GitHub, Heroku, and Ruby on Rails.

Iâ€™m currently: 

-  working on some projects
-  mastering JavaScript and React
-  learning Angular and Spring Boot
