ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I embarked on a coding adventure at Le Wagon boot camp, where I gained hands-on experience with a comprehensive tech stack, including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES6, SQL, Git, GitHub, Heroku, and Ruby on Rails.

- Iâ€™m currently working in some projects and also learning react.
